    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 02, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Travora</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service").</p>

    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. This application is built as a Free app and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>To provide a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information and device permissions.</p>

    <h3>A. Location Data (Fine & Coarse Location)</h3>
    <p>Our app requires access to your device's location to provide its core functionality: <strong>finding places within a 5km radius of your current position.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> Your precise and approximate location coordinates are sent to our backend services (Google Maps Platform and Google Places API) to calculate distances and identify nearby points of interest (e.g., waterfalls, temples, hotels).</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> We do not store your historical location data on our servers. Your location is processed in real-time to provide search results and navigation assistance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. User Accounts (Google Authentication)</h3>
    <p>We use Google Sign-In and Firebase Authentication to manage user accounts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> When you sign up or sign in using Google, we collect your email address, name, and profile picture.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is used to create your user profile, save your chat history securely to the cloud, and personalize your experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Storage (Read/Write Access)</h3>
    <p>The app generates travel schedules (PDFs) based on your interactions with our AI assistant.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Permission:</strong> We require access to your device's storage to save these PDF files so you can view, share, or print your travel itineraries offline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Features</h2>
    <p>Travora includes a chat feature powered by <strong>Google Gemini API</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you interact with the travel assistant, the text you type is sent to Google's AI servers to generate responses and travel itineraries.</li>
        <li>Please do not share sensitive personal information (such as credit card numbers or passwords) in the chat.</li>
        <li>The AI responses are generated automatically and should be verified for accuracy before making travel arrangements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Link to privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS) for all data transmission between the app and our servers. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.</p>
